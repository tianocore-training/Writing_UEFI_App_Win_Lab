Purpose

- Establishes platform common definitions 
- Build-time/Run-time aspects 
- Binary Editing Capabilities 

Goals

- Simplify porting 
- Easy to associate with a module or platform 

Note:




## Slide 5 @title[PCD Syntax review]
### <p align="center">PCD Syntax</span></p>
PCDs can be located anywhere within the Workspace even though a different package will use those PCDs for a given project</span>

Note:

- The Platform configuration database is generated by the build process parsing the build description files that define and specify PCD entries.

- What we see on this slide is how the PCD data is being used in various levels of the build description files

- First we have the DEC file – this Defines a list of PCD tokens that modules can use. 
 	It Defines the PCD entries that will exist under the GUID for that  package, the PCD restriction, valid types for the PCD, and a default value for the PCD. There is a whole syntax and how to define a PCD in the DEC file.

- Next we have PCB entries in the INF file- and this Defines the usage of PCD tokens by the module.
	It Defines what PCD entries are being used within the module, the PCD restriction (or DYNAMIC for none), and a Optional default value for the PCD within this module only.

- Next is the DSC file – This is at the Platform level and describes the contents of the build for a specific platform. 
	PCD entries are assigned values and types for the platform build. You would define a value here to be used by that platform. The value could be different when it is defined in the DEC file but the value in the DSC would be the final value . And They Cannot conflict with established restrictions.

- Not on this slide but also there is the FDF build description File – and this file would have flash layout related values

## Slide 7 @title[EDK II HelloWorld  App  Lab ]
<b>EDK II HelloWorld  App  Lab  </b></p>

First Setup for Building EDK II for Nt32, See <a href="https://gitpitch.com/tianocore-training/Platform_Build_Win_Emulator_Lab/master#/9">Lab Setup for Emulator </a>

Locate and Open <br>
`edk2/MdeModulePkg/Application/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.c`

Notice the PCD values
<br>
<br>
<br>
Build Nt32 Emulation <br>
Then Run HelloWorld at the Shell command interface</span></p>

Note:

- So the steps for getting the source code, hopefully everyone did this prior to this training because it does take some time to download.
- So here are the steps:

- First create a directory, and for our example case we are using the directory “~src/Fw”

- Use instructions on wiki here: https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/UDK2018-How-to-Build or use the lab material edk2 




 

## Slide 8 @title[EDK II HelloWorld  App  Lab steps]
<p align="left"><b>EDK II HelloWorld  App  Lab  </b></p>

Open a VS  Command Prompt and type: `cd C:\FW\edk2-ws` then 
```shell

  C:/FW/edk2-ws> Setenv.bat
  C:/FW/edk2-ws> cd edk2
  C:/FW/edk2-ws/edk2> edksetup.bat

```
Build the EmulatorPkg for Windows X64 (run WinHost.exe from Build/EmulatorX64/ . . ./X64 )


```shell
  C:/FW/edk2-ws/edk2> Build –D ADD_SHELL_STRING
  C:/FW/edk2-ws/edk2> RunEmulator.bat
```
At the UEFI Shell prompt
```shell
Shell> Helloworld
UEFI Hello World!
Shell> 
```

<font color="cyan">How can we force the HelloWorld application to print out 3 times ?</font>


Note:
RunEmulator.bat will run WinHost.exe from Build/EmulatorX64/DEBUG_TAG/X64

Note:

- look in file: `C:\fw\edk2\MdeModulePkg\MdeModulePkg.Dec`

- This PCD defines the print string.
-  This PCD is a sample to explain String typed PCD usage.
-  `gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdHelloWorldPrintString|L"UEFI Hello World!\n"|VOID*|0x40000004`


1. Edit the file C:/FW/edk2-ws/edk2/EmulatorPkg/EmulatorPkg.dsc
  - After the section [PcdsFixedAtBuild], add the new line :  
  - `[PcdsFixedAtBuild]`
  - `gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdHelloWorldPrintTimes|3`

2. Re-Build – Cd to FW/edk2 dir 
  - `bash$ build -D ADD_SHELL_STRING`

- What goes into the Simplest “C”
- Start with what should go into the Simplest .INF file

Note:

- Start with what should go into the Simplest .INF file
- What goes into a Simplest “C”


## Slide 15 @title[Lab 2: Application Lab –start with .c and .inf template]
<p align="left"><span class="gold" ><b>Application Lab –start with .c and .inf template</b></span></p>


### Steps
1. Copy the LabSampleCode/SampleApp directory to FW/edk2
2. Edit SampleApp.inf
  - Look in the INF for “XXXXXXXXXXX” sections that will need information  
  - Create Name & GUID, and then fill in the MODULE_TYPE 


## Slide 16 @title[Lab 2: Sample Application INF file]
<p align="left"><span class="gold" ><b>Lab 2: Sample Application INF file</b></span></p>
<br>

```
 [Defines]
   INF_VERSION  = 0x00010005
   BASE_NAME    = XXXXXXXXXXX
   FILE_GUID    = XXXXXXXXXXX
   MODULE_TYPE  = XXXXXXXXXXX
   VERSION_STRING =   1.0            
   ENTRY_POINT  = UefiMain

 [Sources]
   XXXXXXXXX
 [Packages]
   #XXXXXXXX
  
 [LibraryClasses]
  #XXXXXXXXXXXXX
    
 [Guids]
  # . . .


```

Get a GUID: <a href="http://www.guidgenerator.com/">guidgerator.com</a>

Note:

####  to get a Guid - http://www.guidgenerator.com/

- Now here is a sample INF file
- This is for an application called SampleApp
- When the program starts is going to call the function called UefiMain inside the application. 
- The prototype for UefiMain is predetermined and you can see an example of a prototype by downloading a sample application. 
- So a couple of the things that the prototype will require are a pointer to the system table and a image handle parameter. 


## Slide 17 @title[Lab 2: Sample Application C file]
<p align="left"><span class="gold" ><b>Lab 2: Sample Application ‘C’ file</b></span></p>

 UefiMain (
   IN EFI_HANDLE        ImageHandle,
   IN EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE  *SystemTable

   return EFI_SUCCESS;
 }
 ```


## Slide 18 @title[Lab 2: Will it compile now?]
<p align="left"><span class="gold" ><b>Lab 2: Will it compile now?</b></span></p>
<br>
Not yet . . .
<br>

1. Need to add headers to the .C file 
2. Need to add a reference to INF from the platform DSC 
3. Need to add a few Package dependencies and libraries to the .INF 


Note:

- So the question is will it compile now?
- And the answer is no it will not compile yet
- First you need to add some headers to the.C. we need to be able to let some things.
- We need to add a reference to the INF from the platform in DSC.  Because If you build it now the build is going to say I don’t have a platform and so the build is going to break. 
- Then the next thing we need to add is a few package dependencies and libraries to the INF file because, for instance, features like the UEFI Application entry point will need to be added, because it doesn’t know how to do an entry point until you’ve added that.

 </ul>
</ul>


Note:

- So what are our steps for adding that
- So first we need to add the MDE package to the INF file and you need to reference the file by the DEC file so under the [packages] section you Are going to add “MdePkg/MdePkg.dec” 
- Under the [LibraryClasses] section of the INF you’re going to add a reference to “UefiApplicationsEntryPoint” . And just as an interesting note is actually dependent on the “UefiBootServiecesTableLib”.
- Next in the .C. file you are going to add some header references, the “Uefi.h” and “Library/UefiApplicationEntryPoint.h”  
- Then in the DSC file under the “[components]” section you’re going to add a reference to your new sample INF file.

## Slide 21 @title[Lab 2: Will it compile now? ]
<p align="left"><span class="gold" ><b>Lab 2 : Will it compile now?</b></span></p>
<p style="line-height:90%"><span style="font-size:01.em" >Yes, At the VS Command Prompt</span></p>

```shell
  C:/FW/edk2-ws/edk2> Build –D ADD_SHELL_STRING 
  C:/FW/edk2-ws/edk2> RunEmulator.bat
```
<span style="font-size:01.em" >Run the application from the shell</span>
```shell
 Shell> SampleApp
```
<p style="line-height:70%"><span style="font-size:01.em" >Notice that the program will immediately unload because the main function is empty</span></p>

<span style="font-size:01.em" >Exit</span>
```shell
 Shell> Reset
```

Note:



- And the answer is yes. 
- It will compile and it will even run at this point but we haven’t really added any functionality to this sample code at this point and so since the main function is empty it will unload as soon as it is called.
- So to test it after it has build successfully you then type RunEmulator.batin the EDK2 directory and to run your application type in the base name that you gave it in your INF file, type that name at the shell and it will run, but it won’t do anything because there is nothing for it to do.


- another note:   The program will immediately unload because the main function is empty

<p align="left"><span class="gold" ><b>What we learned from LAB 2</b></span></p>
<br>

1. How to write a simple native UEFI Application
2. Each module requires a .inf file with a unique GUID (use http://www.guidgenerator.com/ )
3. The module created will be the base name defined in the .inf file
4. The module’s .inf  file is required to be included in the platform .dsc file
5. The [Packages] section is required at minimum to include MdePkg/dePkg.dec
6. When using a Build Switch (-D) on the command line it overrides the value in the .DSC file
7. If it is a Library is getting updated, it is required to Build clean or delete the previous built module(s) including the library depending on what is getting re-built.

Add code to print the hex address of the EFI System Table pointer to the console.

Note:



## Slide 35 @title[Lab 3 : Add System Table Code]
<p align="left"><span class="gold" ><b>Lab 3 : Add System Table Code</b></span></p>

Add code to print to the console the hex address of the system table pointer
- Where is the “print” function?
- Where does the app get the pointer value?(compared to mem command below)

pic of  uefi shell `mem` command followed by updated `sampleapp`

Note:

- So let’s extend this and give it something useful to do
 - so for this example we are going to have our sample application print out the system table pointer
- So how do we do that. Well remember to find a function we want we can use the help documentation or CHM file.so what we will find if we do this is that the print function is part of the UefiLib. So in order to add the print functionality we would need to add the UefiLib  to our list of library classes in our INF file
- To see this example look in the files in our sample lab code .c and .inf.
- So also as an exercise you can look at the file in the sample lab code Min.dsc, this is a platform description file without a platform or any packages that go with it,  and this demonstrates the minimal contents for a DSC file that can build this application. So it will build a single application orientated toward the one we just created except nothing else. So unlike the Emulator platform description file, if you were to look at it, There are huge amounts of other components, library classes, and all of that, this Min.dsc only does the minimum requirements.


## Slide 36 @title[Locating the “Print” Function ]
<p align="left"><span class="gold" ><b>Lab 3 : Locating the `Print()` Function </b></span></p>

1. Search the MdePkg.chm and find that the Print function by clicking on the “Index” tab
2. Type “Print” and double click
3. Scroll to the top in the right window to see that the print function is in the UefiLib.h file


Note:



- "MdePkg Document With Libraries.chm" located in ... Lab_Material_FW/FW/Documentation
1. Search the MdePkg.chm and find that the Print function by clicking on the “Index” tab
2. Type “Print” and double click
3. Scroll to the top in the right window to see that the print function is in the UefiLib.h file

## Slide 39 @title[Lab 4: Waiting for an Event]
<br>
<br>
<p align="Left"><span class="gold" >Lab 4: Waiting for an Event</span></p>
<br>

In this lab, you’ll learn how to locate code and .chm files to help write EFI code for waiting for an event

Note:


## Sldie 40 @title[Lab 4 : Add Wait for Event ]
<p align="left"><span class="gold" ><b>Lab 4 : Add Wait for Event</b></span></p>
<br>
Add code to make your application wait for a key press event (`WaitForEvent` / `WaitForKey`)

- Where are these functions located?
- What else can you do with the key press? 
  


Note:

- Add code to make your application wait for an event (WaitForEvent) and use the (WaitForKey) as the event

- Hint: use the MdePkg.chm to find where the “WaitForEvent” and the “WaitForKey” functions are located
- Another Hint: The system table is passed in as a parameter to your sample application
- Search the EDK II code for “WaitForEvent” 
- Test by running your application in the Shell


## Slide 41 @title[Lab 4 : How to locate functions? ]
<p align="left"><span class="gold" ><b>Lab 4 : HOW?</b></span></p>

Locate Functions:  
` WaitForEvent / WaitForKey`

- Search MdePkg.chm - Note: "MdePkg Document With Libraries.chm" located in ... Lab_Material_FW/FW/Documentation
    
     - Locate `WaitForEvent` in Boot Services
     - Locate `WaitForKey` and find ( `EFI_SIMPLE_TEXT_INPUT_PROTOCOL` will be part of `ConIn` ) 
- Check the <a href="http://uefi.org">UEFI Spec</a> for parameters needed:
	   - `WaitForEvent` is referenced via Boot Services pointer, which is referenced via EFI System Table 
     - `WaitForKey`	 can be referenced through the EFI System Table passed into the application
- <font color="yellow"><b>OR</b></font><br> Search the working space for `WaitForEvent` for an example
     - One can be found in <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdePkg/Library/UefiLib/Console.c">MdePkg/Library/UefiLib/Console.c</a>  ~ ln 569: 


Note:

1. Search the MdePkg.chm and find where the “WaitForEvent” is located.  It is part of the “Boot Services”.
2. Search the MdePkg.chm and find where the “WaitForKey” is located.  It is part of the “EFI_SIMPLE_TEXT_INPUT_PROTOCOL as part of ConIn.
3. The WaitForEvent can be referenced through the Boot Services pointer which can be referenced through the System Table
4. The WaitForKey can be referenced through the System Table passed into our Sample application
5. Check the UEFI Spec for the parameters needed
6. An example can be found in MdePkg\Library\UefiLib\Console.c :
  - gBS->WaitForEvent (1, &gST->ConIn->WaitForKey, &EventIndex);



## Slide 42 @title[Lab 4 :Update the C File for WaitForKey ]
<p align="left"><span class="gold" ><b>Lab 4 : Update the C File for `WaitForKey`</b></span></p>
<br>
Search the work space and find the following MdePkg/Library/UefiLib/Console.c  ~ ln 563:
 
Add the following following comment "// Lab 4"

```c++
EFI_STATUS
EFIAPI
UefiMain (
  IN EFI_HANDLE        ImageHandle,
  IN EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE  *SystemTable
  )
{
// Lab 4
 UINTN                      EventIndex; 

// Lab 3
 Print(L"System Table: 0x%p",SystemTable); 

 // Lab 4
 Print(L"\nPress any Key to continue : \n");
 gBS->WaitForEvent (1, &gST->ConIn->WaitForKey, &EventIndex);

 ```

 
## Slide 43 @title[Lab 4 :Test Compile ]
<p align="left"><span class="gold" ><b>Lab 4 :Test Compile</b></span></p>
<br>
However, this won’t compile … gBS and gST are not defined.

Search the MdePkg.chm for “gBS” and “gST” – they are located in UefiBootServicesTableLib.h

Add the boot services lib to SampleApp.c . . .
```
#include <Library/UefiBootServicesTableLib.h>
```

 (hint: Lesson B.4 has the solution)




Note:
- However, this won’t compile … gBS and gST are not defined.

- Search the MdePkg.chm for “gBS” and “gST” – they are located in UefiBootServicesTableLib.h

  - Add the boot services lib to SampleApp.c …
  - #include <Library/UefiBootServicesTableLib.h>

## Slide 46 @title[Lab 5: Creating a Simple Typewriter Function]
<br>
<br>
<p align="Left"><span class="gold" >Lab 5: Creating a Simple Typewriter Function</span></p>
<br>

In this lab, you'll learn how to create a simple typewriter function that retrieves the keys you type and subsequently prints each one back to the console

Note:

 

## Slide 47 @title[Lab 5 :Create a Simple Typewriter Function]
<p align="left"><span class="gold" ><b>Lab 5 : Typewriter Function</b></span></p>
<br>

Create a Simple Typewriter Function using the SampleApp from Lab 4 <br>
<font color="cyan"><b>Requirements:</b></font>

- Retrieve keys entered from keyboard (Like Lab 4)
- Print back each key entered to the console
- To exit, press “.”  (DOT) and then `<Enter>` key



 
## Slide 48 @title[Lab 5 :Create a Simple Typewriter Function How]
<p align="left"><span class="gold" ><b>Lab 5 : Typewriter Function</b></span></p>
<br>
Create a Simple Typewriter Function using the SampleApp from Lab 4

<font color="cyan"><b>How:</b></font></span>
1. Add a Loop using WaitForEvent with WaitForKey
2. Use the ReadKeyStroke function from ConIn 
3. Print back each key to console
4. Exit when  DOT “.” character is followed by an `<Enter>` key




 

## Slide 49 @title[Lab 5 : How Hints]
<p align="left"><span class="gold" ><b>Lab 5 : How Process (Hints)</b></span></p>

- Use the same procedure as with Lab 4 to find “ReadKeyStroke” in the work space: 	<a href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdePkg/Library/UefiLib/Console.c">  MdePkg/Library/UefiLib/Console.c</a> ~ ln 552
```
	Status = gST->ConIn->ReadKeyStroke (gST->ConIn, Key);
```
- ReadKeyStroke uses buffer called EFI_INPUT_KEY ~ ln 393
```
		 OUT EFI_INPUT_KEY  *Key, 
```
- TIP: Good Idea to zero out a buffer in your function – 
  - Use MdePkg.chm to find `ZeroMem` function
  - Use `ZeroMem `on your variable buffer “`Key`” of type `EFI_INPUT_KEY`
- Use Boolean flag “`ExitLoop`” to exit your loop once the user enters a DOT “.” character.

// Lab 5
 Print(L"Enter text. Include a dot ('.') in a sentence then <Enter> to exit:\n "); //
 ZeroMem (&Key, sizeof (EFI_INPUT_KEY));
 gST->ConIn->ReadKeyStroke (gST->ConIn, &Key);
 ExitLoop = FALSE;
 do {    // Do loop until "DOT" and "enter" 
	 gBS->WaitForEvent (1, &gST->ConIn->WaitForKey,&EventIndex);
	 gST->ConIn->ReadKeyStroke (gST->ConIn, &Key);
	 Print(L"%c", Key.UnicodeChar);
	 if (Key.UnicodeChar == CHAR_DOT){
		ExitLoop = TRUE;
    	 }
    } while (!(Key.UnicodeChar == CHAR_LINEFEED  ||  
	    Key.UnicodeChar == CHAR_CARRIAGE_RETURN) || 
       !(ExitLoop) );

 Print(L"\n");
 return EFI_SUCCESS;
